        <p>This convening comes at an opportune time where members states recently adopted the International Labour Convention to address Sexual Harassment in the workplace (ILO Convening), this instrument is critical in guiding states in developing frameworks to address sexual harassment. Moreover, South Africa is in the process of the developing the National Strategic Plan on addressing Gender Based Violence and Femicide, this convening will seek to bring in young women’s voices into the discourse on sexual harassment as form of gender-based violence and more importantly in the context of decent work.</p>

        <h4 className="font-bold">Brief background</h4>
        <p>A study conducted by ActionAid on the role of precarious work and experiences of young women’s preliminary findings reveal that levels of violence against womxn in the workplace are extremely high. Cases of demands of sex in exchange for access that varies in range from CV’s to be reviewed, job offers to be granted, contracts to be signed, promotions and other ordinary benefits are extremely high. The societal norms and values that view young womxn as dispensable, and as a ‘distraction’ to the running of their workplaces leads to lower reporting of sexual harassment in the workplace.</p>
        <p>
            The Young Women’s Lekgotla will serve a platform to reflect on how the ILO convention can be realised to put forward the commitment to seeing change for young womxn in South Africa. This dialogue is therefore an opportunity to answer questions relating to what identifying a violence free workplace for young womxn in South Africa look like?</p>
        <p>Detailed of the Lekgotla are as follows:</p>
