        <h4 className="font-bold">FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 04 March 2025 Generation Gender South Africa to launch a GBV app to combat the scourge of Gender Based-Violence and Femicide (GBVF) in South Africa.</h4>
        <br />
        <h4 className="font-bold">The Generation Gender (GenG) program is launching a new ground breaking app to assist with case monitoring regarding GBVF. Generation G, known as Gen G, is a coalition between ActionAid South Africa, Activate Change Drivers, and Sonke Gender Justice.</h4>
        <br />
        <p>South Africa has a high level of underreporting of GBVF cases. This is due to systematic challenges that include a lack of response by the South African Police Services to assist survivors of GBVF, as well as a and lack of collaboration between various sectors of government departments that are mandated to assist survivors and secondary victims. Despite the existing GBVF legislation in the country, state actors have been slow and apathetic in addressing GBVF.</p>
        <p>Moreover, there is a lack of awareness of available services by community members, activists, and civil society organizations. According to the 2022/2023 statistics revealed by the Ministry of Police, names, the report indicated that over 25,000 murder cases were reported and 3198 of those murders were femicide cases. On 21 February 2025, it was also revealed that crimes against women and children had skyrocketed to 961 murders and 1 661 attempted murders reported. Additionally, 11 803 rape cases were reported countrywide. With this in mind, it is evident beyond reasonable doubt that addressing GBVF demands a multi-layered approach.</p>
        <p>“This is why we are proud to announce the launch of the Gen G Engage app, a zero-rated app that will serve civil society organizations, young people, and the greater communities that we are trying to assist in accessing justice, “ said Generation G SA Manager Sakhile Zungu.</p>
        <p>The app will be a digital platform to critically engage on matters regarding GBVF and will have three components: Access to Justice, Access to Information, and Gen G Engage. The features will serve the following purposes:</p>
        <p>1. <b>The Access to Justice</b> component of the app will be used by the Generation G Network members, university students, and youth in general to effectively monitor GBVF cases from start to finish</p>
        <p>2. The <b>Access to Information</b> component on the app aims to act as a reservoir of information and education materials such as guidelines on reporting cases, GBVF policy position papers and policy submissions, and toolkits on youth participation within the community and structures of power.</p>
        <p>3. The <b>Gen G Engage</b> component will be a digital community-enabling platform for collaboration, support, and mobilization in the promotion of gender justice.</p>
        <p>Currently, there is no digital case-monitoring platform. As we move into the digital age, the civil society sector and agencies that support gender justice efforts have not yet succeeded in using the digital world as an effective space to combat GBVF. The app will be available on iOS and Android for download after the official launch. More details on the official launch will be communicated in due course.</p>
        <p>The launch of the app will enhance collaborations and strengthen solidarity while taking full advantage of digital resources. More details will follow regarding the activations that will be taking place across the country as the rollout of the app occurs THROUGHOUT the country.
