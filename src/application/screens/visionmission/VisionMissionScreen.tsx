                ActionAid South Africa (AASA) has a clear <b>vision</b> of
                realising <b>social justice</b> through supporting the
                <b>actions</b> and <b>power of people</b> whose lives are most
                affected by inequality, injustice and oppression. And so, we
                commit to supporting social movements of the poor, excluded and
                marginalised, prioritising our support for womxn-led feminist
                movements.

                  We strive to develop our programmes with the involvement of
                  the communities we claim to work with. This makes transparency
                  a dual responsibility for us- we are as accountable to you,
                  our donor and we are equally responsible to the communities we
                  work with. This will be visible in the way we report back-
                  while we send updates, event reports, regular reports to our
                  funders, we also ensure that the money we spend on a community
                  is known to them.
