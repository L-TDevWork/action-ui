                  We strive to develop our programmes with the involvement of
                  the communities we claim to work with. This makes transparency
                  a dual responsibility for us- we are as accountable to you,
                  our donor and we are equally responsible to the communities we
                  work with. This will be visible in the way we report back-
                  while we send updates, event reports, regular reports to our
                  funders, we also ensure that the money we spend on a community
                  is known to them.
